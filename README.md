## This contains conversion/decompression tools for some Nintendo Switch file formats.
These tools (currently) can only convert files *from* Nintendo Switch formats into more easily usable ones. They cannot convert back *to* Nintendo Switch formats.  
Note: These tools were made for the Nintendo Switch games **Super Mario Odyssey** and **Super Mario Galaxy 1 (in Super Mario 3D All-Stars)**. They may or may not work with files from other games or consoles.
