## This contains conversion/decompression tools for some Nintendo Switch file formats.
These tools (currently) can only convert files *from* Nintendo Switch formats into more easily usable ones. They cannot convert back *to* Nintendo Switch formats.  
Note: These tools were each made for some of the **Nintendo Switch** games **SMG1 (in SM3DAS)**, **SM3DW+BF**, **SMBW**, and **SMO (v1.2.0)**. They may or may not work with files from other games or consoles.
